In order to replicate the results, you can clone this repository and use the templates given in the files Runs1.ipynb, Runs2.ipynb, and Runs2_cross_model_eval.

These three notebooks call the two Part1.py and Part2.py scripts that train and evaluate agents.

All notebooks have markdown chunks that exlpain what the code chunk below them does.

You can adjust the arguments passed to the agent/evaluator objects in order to further adjust their behavior.

The code usage in the notebooks is quite short and straightforward.

Most of the possible customizations are implemented in the notebooks and by following the code chunks and markdown above them, you can easily understand how they work.
